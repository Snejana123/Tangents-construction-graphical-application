Basic theoretical provisions.

Let's construct a circle with the center O1 in the middle of the segment AO. Let's compose the equation of circles taking into account the transfer of the center O to the origin.

a,b are O1 coordinates.
Let's find the intersection points of the circles - subtract the first from the second equation and express y, substitute the result into the second equation.
